        Sir,
            I am Tarun Parihar resident of the kundan colony. I have a cerious complain about the water supply in our colony. There is no continous supply of the water in our colony. The water is gone 
            in the morning and come at 10:00 am for only 30 min and some times the water is dirty. In evening the water comes at 5:00 pm and gone after 15 min. We are not able to fill the water tanks
            fully. From last 2 days the water is not coming in our area.
                I request you to please either make the water supply continous or change the timing of the water supply and clean the water pipes of our area. 
        Your Truely
        Tarun Parihar
    </pre>
